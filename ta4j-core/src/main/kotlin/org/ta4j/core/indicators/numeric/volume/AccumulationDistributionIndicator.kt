/**
 * Accumulation-distribution indicator.
 *
 * The Accumulation/Distribution Line is a volume-based indicator designed to measure
 * the cumulative flow of money into and out of a security. It uses the Close Location
 * Value (CLV) to determine whether money is flowing into or out of a security.
 *
 * Formula:
 * 1. Money Flow Multiplier = Close Location Value (CLV)
 * 2. Money Flow Volume = Money Flow Multiplier Ã— Volume
 * 3. AD = Previous AD + Money Flow Volume
